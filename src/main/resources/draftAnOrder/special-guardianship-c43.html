<h2> Warning </h2>

Where a Special Guardianship Order is in force no person may cause the child to be known by a new surname or remove the child from the United Kingdom without either the written consent of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the court.
However, this does not prevent the removal of a child for a period of less than 3 months, by its special guardian(s) (Section 14C (3) and (4) Children Act 1989).</br></br>

It may be a criminal offence under the Child Abduction Act 1984 to remove the child from the United Kingdom without leave of the court.</br></br>
